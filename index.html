                                    Many supervised learning methods are naturally cast as optimization problems. For prediction models which are linear in their parameters, this often leads to convex problems for which many guarantees exist. Models which are non-linear in their parameters such as neural networks lead to non-convex optimization problems for which guarantees are harder to obtain, but many empirical successes are reported. In this talk, I will present recent results on two-layer neural networks where the number of hidden neurons tends to infinity, and show how qualitative convergence guarantees may be derived.

                                        Robotics offers a challenging problem in the field of artificial intelligence. Among the various open problems in robotics, I favor legged locomotion the most, for the variety of open questions, but also the representativeness of these problems for many other robots. Legged locomotion implies autonomy, dynamics, mobility, accuracy and speed, dimensionality and controllability. The current solution to this challenge, beautifully demonstrated by Boston Dynamics this winter, implies tailored reduced models and trajectory optimization of the so-called centroidal dynamics. While we proudly contributed to this approach, we now believe that the next level is to produce similar movements, or better, without relying on ad-hoc simplification. We will explain how careful modeling, numerical optimization and predictive control enable us to optimize the whole-body dynamics, accounting in real time for the 30 robot motors and various balance or collision constraints. While the optimal control problem to solve in real time is nonconvex, we relied on a memory of motion, trained off-line on a large database of planed movements, to guide the numerical algorithm to the optimum. The resulting control corresponds to the optimal policy, yet it is optimized in real-time from a gross approximation by rolling out the robot predicted movements. Our next step is to understand how reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm can be made more accurate, and faster to converge, in order to obtain a fair closed-form approximation of the optimal policy, which matches the accuracy level that is required by our legged machines. To that end, we are investigating second-order RL algorithms, exploiting the derivatives of the model and locally optimal roll-outs.

                                    As ML computations increasingly become embedded within larger chains of computation, and data-subsampling drastically affects computational precision, tracking and controlling computational errors across the program flow becomes a key functionality of ML solutions. I will present some recent results showcasing the ability of probabilistic numerical algorithms to address this issue in a mathematically clean, and computationally lightweight fashion.

                                        Many practical applications require to infer a desired quantity from measurements that contain implicit information about them, commonly resulting in ill-posed inverse reconstruction problems. While classical approaches formulate their solution as the argument that minimizes a suitable cost function, recent works excel on image reconstruction benchmarks using deep learning. This talk will discuss advantages and drawbacks of both approaches, exemplify recent advances on their confluence, and highlight future challenges in learnable energy minimization methods and bi-level learning.

                                            AutoML has become a standard tool for automatically configuring complex ML systems in the last 10 years, in order to shield users from manual trial and error decisions regarding model selection, hyperparameters, preprocessing and feature extraction. Although many practical tools are already freely available, many challenges remain, and this talk will briefly introduce and discuss the most relevant ones from our perspective.

This includes: a) Recent benchmarking results and the state of available data; b) the need for multicriteria evaluation and optimization to cope with complex application scenarios; c) measuring and optimizing for interpretability and trustworthiness.

                                        In this talk we present recent progress on large-scale learning of multimodal video representations. We start by presenting VideoBert, a joint model for video and language, repurposing the Bert model for multimodal data. This model achieves state-of-the-art results on zero shot prediction and video captioning. Next we show how to extend learning from instruction videos to general movies based on cross-modal supervision. We use movie
    screenplays to learn a speech to action classifiers and use these classifiers to mine video clips from thousands of hours of movies. We demonstrate a performance comparable or better than fully supervised approaches for
    action classification. Next we present an approach for video question answering which relies on training from instruction videos and cross-modal supervision with a textual question answer module. We show state-of-the-art results for video question answering without any supervision (zero-shot
    VQA) and demonstrate that our approach obtains competitive results for pre-training and then fine-tuning on video question answering datasets. We conclude our talk by presenting a recent video feature which is fully transformer based. Our Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art on video classification. Furthermore, it is flexible and allows for performance / accuracy trade-off based on several different architectures.

                                        In many types of human learning, task descriptions are a
                                        central ingredient.  They are usually accompanied by a few
                                        examples, but there is very little human learning that is
                                        based on examples only. In contrast, the typical learning
                                        setup for NLP tasks lacks task descriptions and is
                                        supervised with 100s or 1000s of examples. This is even true
                                        for so-called few-shot learning, a term often applied to
                                        scenarios with tens of thousands of "shots".

                                        Inspired by the GPT models, which also exploit task
                                        descriptions, we introduce Pattern-Exploiting Training
                                        (PET). PET reformulates task descriptions as cloze questions
                                        that can be effectively processed by pretrained language
                                        models.  In contrast to GPT, PET combines task descriptions
                                        with supervised learning. We show that PET learns well from
                                        as little as ten training examples and outperforms GPT-3 on
                                        GLUE even though it has 99.9% fewer parameters.

                                    Many problems in genomics require the ability to identify relevant features in data sets containing many more orders of magnitude than samples. One such example is genome-wide association studies (GWAS), in which hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms are measured for orders of magnitude fewer samples. In this talk, I will present methods based on structured regularization and post-selection inference to address the statistical and computational issues that arise in this context.

                                    Single-view reconstruction was popularized with deep learning. After the initial excitement about the possibility to retrieve good looking depth maps and even full 3D object shapes from only a single view, recently, some doubts have appeared on how deep learning manages the task and how sustainable the process is when it is applied outside academic benchmarks. Especially for 3D shape reconstruction, performance is very poor when deviating too much from the training distribution and even providing ground truth depth maps as input cannot fix the problem. In this talk, I will argue that this is an issue of the training procedure, which focuses entirely on global shape priors, whereas there is nothing in the procedure that fosters recombination of local structures in the data. I will also present a simple way to fix this and demonstrate that this has dramatic effects on generalization.

                                        This presentation addresses the problem of reconstructing a high-resolution image from multiple lower-resolution snapshots captured from slightly different viewpoints in space and time. Key challenges for solving this super-resolution} problem include (i) aligning the input pictures with sub-pixel accuracy, (ii) handling raw (noisy) images for maximal faithfulness to native camera data, and (iii) designing/learning an image prior (regularizer) well suited to the task.  We address these three challenges with a hybrid algorithm building on the insight that aliasing is an ally in this setting, with parameters that can be learned end to end, while retaining the interpretability of classical approaches to inverse problems. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on synthetic and real image bursts, setting a new state of the art on several benchmarks and delivering excellent qualitative results on real raw bursts captured by smartphones and prosumer cameras. </br>

                                        While neural networks have swept the field of computer vision and replaced  classical methods in most areas of image analysis and beyond, extending their power to the domain of camera-based 3D reconstruction remains an important open challenge. In my talk, I will advocate hybrid methods which integrate deep network predictions to boost the performance of direct visual SLAM approaches. The resulting method allows us to track a single camera with a precision that is on par with state-of-the-art stereo-inertial odometry methods.

                                    Self-supervised learning using huge unlabeled data has been successfully explored for image processing and natural language processing. Since 2019, recent works also investigated self-supervised representation learning from speech. They were notably successful to improve performance on downstream tasks such as speech recognition. These recent works suggest that it is possible to reduce dependence on labeled data for building speech systems through acoustic representation learning. In this talk I will present an overview of these recent approaches to self-supervised learning from speech and show my own investigations to use them in spoken language processing tasks for which size of training data is limited.

                                    Simultaneously sampling from a complex distribution with intractable normalizing constant and approximating expectations under this distribution is a challenging problem. We introduce a novel scheme, inspired by the the non-equilibrium sampling introduced by (Rotskoff and Vanden-Eijnden (2019), called Invertible Flow Non Equilibrium Sampling (InFine). InFine departs from classical Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. InFine constructs unbiased estimators of expectations and in particular of normalizing constants by combining the orbits of a deterministic transform started from random initializations. When this transform is chosen as an appropriate integrator of a conformal Hamiltonian system, these orbits are optimization paths. InFine is also naturally suited to design new MCMC sampling schemes by selecting samples on the optimization paths.Additionally, InFine can be used to construct an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) leading to a new class of Variational AutoEncoders (VAE).

                                    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successful in producing outstanding results in areas as diverse as image, video, and text generation. Building on these successes, a large number of empirical studies have validated the benefits of the cousin approach called Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), which brings stabilization in the training process. In the present contribution, we add a new stone to the edifice by proposing some theoretical advances in the properties of WGANs. First, we properly define the architecture of WGANs in the context of integral probability metrics parameterized by neural networks and highlight some of their basic mathematical features. We stress in particular interesting optimization properties arising from the use of a parametric 1-Lipschitz discriminator. Then, in a statistically-driven approach, we study the convergence of empirical WGANs as the sample size tends to infinity, and clarify the adversarial effects of the generator and the discriminator by underlining some trade-off properties. These features are finally illustrated with experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

                                        The goal of metric learning is to learn a function that maps samples to a lower-dimensional space where similar samples lie closer than dissimilar ones. In the case of deep metric learning, the mapping is performed by training a neural network. Most approaches rely on losses that only take the relations between pairs or triplets of samples into account, which either belong to the same class or to two different classes. However, these approaches do not explore the embedding space in its entirety. To this end, we propose an approach based on message passing networks that takes into account all the relations in a mini-batch. We refine embedding vectors by exchanging messages among all samples in a given batch allowing the training process to be aware of the overall structure. Since not all samples are equally important to predict a decision boundary, we use dot-product self-attention during message passing to allow samples to weight the importance of each neighbor accordingly. We achieve state-of-the-art results on clustering and image retrieval on the CUB-200-2011, Cars196, Stanford Online Products, and In-Shop Clothes datasets.

                                        Trustworthy AI has become an important issue. Explainable and fair AI have already matured and research on robustness is flourishing. Where most papers address developers or application engineers, at ML2R, we offer care labels that are easy to understand at a glance. They move beyond the description of the methods by exploiting theoretical results about methods, where possible. Moreover, the certification suite generates systematic testing which checks a given implementation on a certain hardware justifying the particular labels. Two first instances have been developed, one for probabilistic graphical models, and one for ResNet-18 and MobileNetV3 applied to ImageNet.

                                        Machine learning (ML) models deployed in production environments are commonly embedded in an iterative process involving numerous steps, including source selection, information extraction, information integration, model building, and model application. In this presentation, we will take a closer look at this process from the perspective of the data management community, which has provided numerous tools and technologies to improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of this iterative process for traditional relational data analyis. In particular, we will discuss the differences and potential for applying these DM techniques to the management of both ML and data science-oriented computer programs. In particular, leveraging declarative languages in conjunction with automatic distribution, parallelization and hardware adaption help, to reduce the complexity of the specification and improve human latency. Furthermore, exploiting scalable, parallel and distributed algorithms jointly with modern hardware, to improve both the efficiency of the deployment and technical latency. Lastly, we will present a concrete example of an open-source data stream processing system based on our research, and highlight the current research agenda of BIFOLD at the intersection of Big Data and Machine Learning.

                                    One of the hottest areas of machine learning in recent times has been Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). In SSL, a learning machine captures the dependencies between variables, and learns representations of the data without requiring human-provided labels.  SSL pre-training has revolutionized NLP and is making very fast progress in speech and image recognition. SSL may enable machines to learn predictive models of the world through observation, and to learn representation of the perceptual world with massive amounts of uncurated data,  thereby reducing the amount of labeled samples to learn a downstream task. I will review some of the most recent progress and promising avenues for SSL.

                                    The talk will discuss the relationship between statistical and causal learning, and some thoughts on how to address shortcomings of statistical learning by taking into account causal structures. It will also discuss the problem of ‘disentanglement’ from the causal point of view.

                                        I will address in this presentation the problem of non-blind deblurring and demosaicking of noisy raw images. The proposed approach adapts to raw photographs a learning-based approach to RGB image deblurring by introducing a new interpretable module that jointly demosaicks and deblurs them. The model is trained on RGB images converted into raw ones using a realistic invertible camera pipeline, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on several benchmarks. The proposed algorithm is also used to remove a camera’s inherent blur (its color-dependent point-spread function) in real images, in essence deblurring sharp images.

                                        Machine learning models may show Clever-Hans like moments when solving a task by learning the “wrong” thing, e.g. making use of confounding factors within a data set. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find out whether, say, a deep neural network is making Clever-Hans-type mistakes because they are not reflected in the standard performance measures such as precision and recall. While visual explanations go beyond precision and recall, they are also just a reminiscent of a child who points towards something but cannot articulate why something is relevant. In contrast, symbols may allow to access deep networks at the concept level and in turn to fix Clever-Hans behavior at a more general level. I will demonstrate that this is not insurmountable by  presenting novel object-based deep networks for 2D/3D scene interpretation of images.

    This talk is based on joint works with Adam Kosiorek, Patrick Schramowski, Wolfgang Stammer, and Karl Stelzner.
